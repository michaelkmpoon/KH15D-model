#  KH15D-model

[KH 15D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH_15D) is a system that consists of a young, eccentric binary, and a circumbinary disc that obscures the binary as the disc precesses.

##  Overview

## Code

## 1. [code/kh15d_finalmodel.ipynb](code/kh15d_finalmodel.ipynb) 

MCMC code (using emcee) used to model KH 15D photometry, which is described in Section 2. Makes results in Table 2 and Figure B1. 

Also available as a Python script [kh15d_finalmodel.py](kh15d_finalmodel.py).

## 2. [code/makeFoldedLightcurves.ipynb](code/makeFoldedLightcurves.ipynb) 

Makes Fig. 3, 4, and 5.
